# YouTube Uploader Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up Google authentication to enable YouTube uploads in the Media Uploader application.

## Prerequisites

- A Google account
- Python 3.8+ installed
- The Media Uploader application installed

## Step 1: Create a Google Cloud Project

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click "Select a project" at the top of the page
3. Click "New Project"
4. Enter a project name (e.g., "Media Uploader")
5. Click "Create"

## Step 2: Enable YouTube Data API v3

1. In your Google Cloud project, go to the [APIs & Services > Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library)
2. Search for "YouTube Data API v3"
3. Click on "YouTube Data API v3"
4. Click "Enable"

## Step 3: Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials

1. Go to [APIs & Services > Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
3. If prompted, configure the OAuth consent screen:
   - Choose "External" user type
   - Fill in the required fields (App name, User support email, Developer contact information)
   - Add scopes: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload`
   - Add test users (your Google account email)
   - Complete the configuration

4. Back in Credentials, click "Create Credentials" ‚Üí "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
5. Choose "Desktop application" as the application type
6. Give it a name (e.g., "Media Uploader Desktop")
7. Click "Create"

## Step 4: Download and Configure Credentials

1. After creating the OAuth 2.0 client, click the download button (‚¨áÔ∏è) next to your client
2. Save the downloaded JSON file as `client_secret.json`
3. Create a `private` folder in your Media Uploader application directory
4. Move `client_secret.json` to the `private` folder

Your directory structure should look like this:
```
media_uploader/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ private/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ client_secret.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ services/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
```

## Step 5: Install Dependencies

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 6: Test the Setup

1. Run the Media Uploader application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. The authentication widget should show "Setup required" initially
3. Click the "‚ÑπÔ∏è" button to verify your setup
4. If everything is configured correctly, click "üîë Login with Google"
5. A browser window will open for Google authentication
6. Sign in with your Google account and grant the requested permissions
7. You should see "‚úÖ Logged in as [your-email]" in the application

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Client secret file not found"**
- Ensure `client_secret.json` is in the `private` folder
- Check that the file name is exactly `client_secret.json` (case sensitive)

**"Invalid client secret format"**
- Make sure you downloaded the OAuth 2.0 client credentials (not service account)
- Verify the JSON file contains an "installed" section

**"Access denied" during login**
- Check that you enabled YouTube Data API v3
- Verify your OAuth consent screen is configured
- Make sure your email is added as a test user (if using external user type)

**"Quota exceeded" errors**
- YouTube Data API has daily quotas
- Check your quota usage in Google Cloud Console
- Consider requesting quota increase for production use

### File Permissions (Linux/macOS)

If you encounter permission issues:

```bash
# Set proper permissions on the private directory
chmod 700 private/
chmod 600 private/client_secret.json
```

### Windows Security

On Windows, ensure the `private` folder is not shared or accessible by other users.

## Security Notes

- Keep your `client_secret.json` file secure and never share it
- The `private` folder is automatically added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits
- Credentials are stored locally and encrypted where possible
- Logout when not using the application to revoke access

## API Quotas and Limits

YouTube Data API v3 has the following limits:
- **Daily quota**: 10,000 units (default)
- **Upload quota**: Varies by account type
- **File size**: Up to 128GB per video
- **Video length**: Up to 12 hours

### Quota Usage
- Video upload: ~1,600 units
- Video listing: ~1 unit
- Channel info: ~1 unit

Monitor your quota usage in the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials).

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom OAuth Scopes

If you need additional permissions, modify the scopes in `core/auth_manager.py`:

```python
SCOPES = [
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload',
    'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.readonly'
]
```

### Multiple Accounts

To use multiple Google accounts:
1. Logout from the current account
2. Clear the `private` folder (except `client_secret.json`)
3. Login with the new account

### Production Deployment

For production use:
1. Set up a proper OAuth consent screen with verified domain
2. Request quota increases
3. Implement proper error handling and monitoring
4. Consider using service accounts for server-side operations

## Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the application logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify your Google Cloud project configuration
3. Ensure all dependencies are installed correctly
4. Check the troubleshooting section above
